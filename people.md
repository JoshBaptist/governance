## New Steering Council Members

The process for becoming a Steering Council Member is documented in the [Governance document](governance.md#council-membership)

The following tasks need to be completed when a new member joins the steering council:

- Announce the new member on the Open Data Cube mailing list
- Make the new member an org owner and Open Data Cube Github organizations
- Add the new member to the list in the governance repo, and if appropriate, add their affiliation to the [institutional partner list](people.md)
